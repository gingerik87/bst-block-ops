Guys, ill soon (probably in the next few updates) start working on an actual match system and compatibility beetween the offline Loadout system and the online/multiplayer one. The first game mode i will probably be working on is Duel Arcade. 
Im not sure if ill release the pack with just the Training Camp (just an offline map)
