# About

Block Ops transforms Minecraft into a competitive FPS playground. Whether itâ€™s a fast duel in a custom arena or completing a skill-based training course, Block Ops brings combat mechanics that feel right at home yet completely new.
Features

âš¡ Smooth movement â€“ sprinting, crawling, leaning, and more.

ðŸ”« Gunplay that feels good â€“ recoil, reloads, and satisfying sound effects.

ðŸŽ¯ Tutorial & Shooting Range â€“ learn mechanics before hitting real matches.

ðŸ—º Custom maps â€“ designed for FPS gameplay, not just survival.

# Why

Minecraft has an amazing modding community, but FPS experiences often feel clunky or underdeveloped.
Block Ops was made to push the boundaries â€” to prove that Minecraft can deliver tight, satisfying shooter gameplay without losing its charm.
How It Works

Block Ops is built with a combination of mods, custom assets, and tailored maps.
Multiplayer runs via LAN with e4mc integration, and in the future, there will be a match system to easily join ongoing games.
