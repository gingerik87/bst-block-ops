About

Block Ops transforms Minecraft into a competitive FPS playground. Whether it’s a fast duel in a custom arena or completing a skill-based training course, Block Ops brings combat mechanics that feel right at home yet completely new.
Features

    ⚡ Smooth movement – sprinting, crawling, leaning, and more.

    🔫 Gunplay that feels good – recoil, reloads, and satisfying sound effects.

    🎯 Tutorial & Shooting Range – learn mechanics before hitting real matches.

    🗺 Custom maps – designed for FPS gameplay, not just survival.

    🎙 The Captain – your personal tutorial guide (soon an iconic figure).

Why

Minecraft has an amazing modding community, but FPS experiences often feel clunky or underdeveloped.
Block Ops was made to push the boundaries — to prove that Minecraft can deliver tight, satisfying shooter gameplay without losing its charm.
How It Works

Block Ops is built with a combination of mods, custom assets, and tailored maps.
Multiplayer runs via LAN with e4mc integration, and in the future, there will be a match system to easily join ongoing games.
Installation

    Download the latest release from Modrinth (link when ready).

    Install Minecraft Forge (version X.X.X).

    Place the .jar in your mods folder.

    Launch Minecraft and select the Forge profile.
