# Block Ops

The First Person Shooter Minecraft Project

Block Ops is a fast-paced, tactical FPS experience built inside Minecraft. It combines smooth movement mechanics, immersive gunplay, and unique environments — all without leaving your favorite blocky world.

# About

Block Ops transforms Minecraft into a competitive FPS playground. Whether it’s a fast duel in a custom arena or completing a skill-based training course, Block Ops brings combat mechanics that feel right at home yet completely new.
Features

 Smooth movement – sprinting, crawling, leaning, and more.
 
 Gunplay that feels good – recoil, reloads, and satisfying sound effects.
 
 Tutorial & Shooting Range – learn mechanics before hitting real matches.

 Custom maps – designed for FPS gameplay, not just survival.

# Why

Minecraft has an amazing modding community, but FPS experiences often feel clunky or underdeveloped.
Block Ops was made to push the boundaries — to prove that Minecraft can deliver tight, satisfying shooter gameplay without losing its charm.
How It Works

Block Ops is built with a combination of mods, custom assets, and tailored maps.
Multiplayer runs via LAN with e4mc integration, and in the future, there will be a match system to easily join ongoing games.
